# Why?
Sometimes you need to demonstrate to stakeholders or to product owners why particular splits in experience work best and should be delivered in a particular way OR why a particular feature should be delayed first in order for the experience to work properly and not seem back to front.

I've used this template in the past many times for those exact reasons and they've been receive very well. I hope if you're in a similar situation, you find them as useful as I have!

# How
Just drag and drop your images and export the template out. I found that its best placed on a wall, where you can walk anyone through it!

Most hand on PI planning days!
